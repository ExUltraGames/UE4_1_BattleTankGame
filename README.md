## GDD

Tank Battle, open world head to head combat game
Terrain used for tactical advantage
Focus on flow & feel

Rules
Move anywhere, surrounded by mountains
Both players start with finite health and ammo
direct hit reduces health
last player standing = winner

Requirements
SFX - gun, explosion, barrel / turret moving, engine
Static Meshes (star with primitive objects) - simple tank comprising tracks, body, turret & barrel
Textures - add for visual flare later
Music - background music for tension

## Iterative Cycle
World -> tank-> control -> player 2 (AI or human) -> User Interface (UI) -> world (repeat)
